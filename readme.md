Requirements: 
The CD-ROM System BIOS for PC Engine / TurboGrafx-16 is required only for CD based games. 

Rename it to tgfx16.rom and place it at the root of the SD card or inside the tgfx16 folder. 

You could even rename it to whatever name you prefer adding the .pce extension. For example, cdrombios.pce and

load it as a normal cartridge whenever you want to use the CD BIOS.
